# Package Title Here with one '#'

Blurb about what this package does in one sentence here. Optional badges and 
multiple paragraphs but it may belong in an Introduction if it is long.

<!-- ToC start -->
Contents section will be filled in here by markdown-toc
<!-- ToC end -->

## Top level sections of document have two #s

### Subsections have 3 #s

#### 4, and more, if you want, but this should be enough.

To regenerate the table of contents:

```
markdown-toc README.md --replace --skip-headers 2 --inline --header "## Contents"
```
