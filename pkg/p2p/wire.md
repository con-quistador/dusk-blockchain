# DUSK Network Wire Protocol Documentation

## Message encoding

Messages sent over the wire are length-prefixed frames of data, with the
following structure:

| Field | Size \(bytes\) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Packet Length | 8 |
| Magic | 4 |
| Reserved | 8 |
| Checksum | 4 |

## Topics

Below is a list of supported topics which can be sent and received over the
wire:

* Version

* Ping
* Pong
* Inv
* GetData
* GetBlocks
* Block
* Tx
* MemPool

## Common structures

This section defines the common structures that are used in wire messages. Field
types are denoted as their golang types.

### VarInt

Much like VarInt in Bitcoin, it is used to encode variable sized numbers to save
space.

| Value | Size | Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| &lt; 0xFD | 1 | uint8 |
| &lt;= 0xFFFF | 3 | 0xFD followed by a uint16 |
| &lt;= 0xFFFFFFFF | 5 | 0xFE followed by a uint32 |
| &gt; 0xFFFFFFFF | 9 | 0xFF followed by a uint64 |

### protocol.Version

## Message outline

Below follows an outline and description for each message that can be sent and
received over the wire. Field types are denoted as their golang types.

### Version

| Field Size | Title | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 4 | Version | protocol.Version | The version of the Dusk protocol that this node is running. Formatted as semver |
| 8 | Timestamp | int64 | UNIX timestamp of when the message was created |
| 4 | Service flag | uint32 | Identifier for the services this node offers |

A version message, which is sent when a node attempts to connect with another
node in the network. The receiving node sends it's own version message back in
response. Nodes should not send any other messages to each other until both of
them have sent a version message.

### VerAck

This message is sent as a reply to the version message, to acknowledge a peer
has received and accepted this version message. It contains no other
information.

### Ping

This message is used to inquire if a node is still active and maintaining its
connection on the other end. The Ping message contains no other information.

### Pong

This message is used to respond to other nodes' Ping messages, informing them
that a connection is still being maintained. It carries no other information.

### Inv

| Field Size | Title | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-9 | Count | VarInt | Amount of items contains in the inventory message |
| 33 \* Count | Inv List | \[\]peermsg.InvVect | Inventory items |

Inventory messages are used to advertise transactions and blocks to the network.
It can be received unsolicited, or as a reply to GetBlocks.

### GetData

A GetData message is sent as a response to an inventory message, and should
contain the hashes of the items that the peer wishes to receive the data for. It
is structed exactly the same as the Inv message, only the header topic differs.

### GetBlocks

| Field Size | Title | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-9 | Count | VarInt | Amount of locators |
| 32 \* Count | Locators | \[\]\[\]byte | Locator hashes, revealing a node's last known block |

A GetBlocks message is sent when a block is received which has a height that is
further than 1 apart from the currently known highest block. When a GetBlocks is
sent, an Inv is returned containing up to 500 block hashes that the requesting
peer is missing, which it can then download with GetData.

### Block

| 83 | Certificate | Block Certificate |  |
| 32 | Hash | \[\]byte | Hash of this block |
| ?? | Txs | \[\]tx | All transactions contained in this block |

A Dusk block. Note that the certificate is generated during consensus. For this
reason, this field is empty when a block is transmitted with a Candidate
message.

The block hash is the hash of the following fields:

* Version
* Height
* Timestamp
* Previous block hash
* Seed

### Tx

| 80 | Fee | uint64 | Amount of DUSK paid in fees |
| ?? | Spending Proof | \[\]byte | Proof of ownership of spent notes in the transaction |
| ?? | Call Data | \[\]byte | Collection of VM instructions and arguments |

### MemPool

This message is used to request the mempool contents of another node in the
network. Used by nodes which just recently joined, and wish to have an updated
view of the current pending transaction queue. Responses are typically given
with `Inv` messages. The message carries no other information.

### Candidate

| Field Size | Title | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ?? | Block | Block |  |

A standalone candidate block provided to a requesting node. This message will
only be sent out in response to a `GetCandidate`, as the candidate block is
normally included in a `NewBlock` message.

### GetCandidate

| Field Size | Title | Data Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 32 | Block Hash | \[\]byte | Hash of the requested candidate block |

This message can be used by nodes which are missing a certain candidate block at
any point during consensus. Responses will be of the `Candidate` topci.

### NewBlock

| 32 | Block Hash | \[\]byte | Hash of the candidate block |
| 32 | Identity | \[\]byte | Identity hash |
| 33 | Seed | \[\]byte | Seed of the proposed block |
| 32 | Previous Hash | \[\]byte | Hash of the previous block |
| ?? | Candidate | Block | Candidate block |

A consensus NewBlock message, generated by an extracted Provisioner of the
Selection step. It propagates the Candidate block.

### Reduction

| 129 | BLS Public Key | \[\]byte | Sender's BLS Public Key |
| 8 | Round | uint64 | Consensus round |
| 1 | Step | uint8 | Consensus step |
| 32 | Block Hash | \[\]byte | The block hash that this node is voting on |
| 33 | Signed Hash | \[\]byte | Compressed BLS Signature of the block hash field |

A reduction message, sent by provisioners during consensus. It is essentially a
vote for one of the Candidate blocks they received prior to the reduction phase.

### Agreement

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 129 | BLS Public Key | \[\]byte | Sender's BLS Public Key |
| 8 | Round | uint64 | Consensus round |

| ?? | Committee Representation | big.Int | Bitmap representation of committee members which voted |

An agreement message, sent by provisioners during consensus. It's a compressed
collection of all the votes that were cast in 2 steps of reduction, and is
paramount in reaching consensus on a certain block.
