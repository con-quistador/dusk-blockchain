# [pkg/core/mempool](./pkg/core/mempool)

Package mempool represents the chain transaction layer \(not to be confused with
DB transaction layer\). A blockchain transaction has one of a finite number of
states at any given time. Below are listed the logical states of a transaction.

## States

| Name | Desc |  | Started by | Transitions |  |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| created | tx data was built with RPC call |  | RPC subsystem |  |  |
| signed | tx data was signed with RPC call |  | RPC subsystem |  |  |
| received | tx was pushed into mempool by external subsystem \(RPC, P2P node, etc\) |  | Mempool | signed -&gt; received |  |
|  |  |  | Mempool | propagated -&gt; received |  |
| verified | tx passed the tx verification rules |  | Mempool | received -&gt; verified |  |
| propagated | tx was gossiped to the P2P network |  | P2P network | verified -&gt; propagated |  |
| accepted | tx is part of a block that was accepted by the network |  | Mempool | propagated -&gt; accepted |  |
| stale | tx was removed due to exceeding expiry period |  | Mempool | any -&gt; stale |  |

Mempool participates in the following transitions

* from `created/signed` to `received`
* from `received` to `verified`
* from `verified` to `propagated`
* from `propagated` to `accepted`

## Mempool responsibilities:

* Store all transactions that are `received` from RPC call or P2P message ready
  to be verified
* Execute transaction verification procedure
* Store all transactions that are `verified` by the chain and can be included in
  next candidate block
* Update internal state on newly accepted block
* Monitor and report for abnormal situations

## Implementation

Mempool implementation tries to avoid use of mutex to protect shared state.
Instead, all input/output communication is based on channels. Similarily to Unix
Select\(..\) sementics, mempool waits on read/write \(input/output/timeout\)
channels to trigger an event handler

### Underlying pool

In addition, mempool tries to be storage-agnostic so that a verified tx can be
stored in different forms of persistent and non-persistent pools. Supported and
pending ideas for pools:

* hashmap - based on golang map implements non-persistent pool. Supported
* syncpool - based sync.Pool. Pending
* distributed - distributed memory object caching system \(e.g memcached\).
  Pending
* persistent - persistent KV storage. Pending
