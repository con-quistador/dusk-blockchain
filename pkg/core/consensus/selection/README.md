# [pkg/core/consensus/selection](./pkg/core/consensus/selection)

The `Selector` is the component appointed to collect the scores, verify the _
zero-knowledge proof_ thereto associated and to propagate the _block hash_
associated with the highest score observed during a period of time denoted
as `timeLength`. The _block hash_ is then forwarded to the `EventBus` to be
picked up by the `Block Reducer`

An abstract description of the Selection phase in the SBA\* consensus protocol
can be found [here](./selection.md).

## Abstract

`Block Generators` \(a role taken outside of the Provisioner\) participate in a
non-interactive lottery to be able to forge a candidate block. In order to
decide which Block to select among the various candidates,
the `Block Generators` propagate a score associated with their candidate block,
which is the result of the lottery run in a non-interactive fashion. Together
with the score, the `Block Generators` publish a _zero-knowledge proof_ of
correctness of the score computation according to the rules outlined in
the [`Blind Bid` algorithm](../blockgenerator/README.md).

## Values

### Score Message

| Field | Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| score | uint256 |
| proof | proof |
| identity hash | uint256 |
| seed | BLS signature |
| previous block hash | uint256 |
| candidate block | [block.Block](../../data/block/block.go) |

## Architecture

The Selection component is implemented through the `Phase` struct. Internally,
it carries a `BlockGenerator` in order to fully synchronize the creation of a
candidate block and score, with the Selection phase. When the Selection
component is called, the first thing it does is this block generation routine.
Once finished (or if no block generator was actually initialized), queued events
are flushed in order to catch up with any delays, and a listening loop is
started. The selection component will listen on four channels:

- The `internalScoreResult` chan, on which it can receive a `Score` message from
  its own block generator - this message is then forwarded into the standard
  processing pipeline
- The `evChan`, which catches events coming from the network
- The `timeOutChan`, responsible for telling the Selection component when the
  time for the selection phase has ran out, and the component needs to wrap up
  its activites
- The `ctx.Done` chan, which notifies the Selection component of context
  cancellations, and allows for swift cleanup of the hanging goroutine

When an event comes through over the `evChan`, the following processing pipeline
is followed:

1. Check if the event score is higher than the current `bestEvent`. If not, the
   flow ends here.
2. Verify the proof, included in the `Score` event. If the verification fails,
   the flow ends here.
3. The `Score` event is repropagated to the network.
4. The `bestEvent` field on the Selection component will now be set to the
   new `Score` event.

The purpose of this processing flow is to have the `Score` message with the
highest score in memory when the timer expires. Once this timer expires, the
message is returned and can be used to vote in
the [reduction step](../reduction/README.md).
